## Developers

### Dependencies

This template relies on the user having `pnpm` installed on their system.  
This can be downloaded from `npm` itself which is recommended. 

#### Linux

```bash
sudo npm i -g pnpm
```

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to use as an example for making your plugin.
2. In your clone of the repository run these commands:
   1. ``pnpm i``
   2. ``pnpm run build``
3. You should do this every time you make changes to your plugin.

Note: If you are recieveing build errors due to an out of date library, you should run this command inside of your repository:

```bash
pnpm update decky-frontend-lib --latest
```

### Distribution

WIP. Check back in later.
